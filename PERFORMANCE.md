# PERFORMANCE

Explicit performance contract. Every budget is a CI gate; violation fails the build. Targets are world-class ceiling, not Web Vitals "good" floor.

## User-perceived budgets

| Metric | Budget | Measured at |
|---|---|---|
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | ≤ 1.0s on cable, ≤ 2.0s on slow 4G | Real-user (RUM) + Lighthouse-CI synthetic |
| INP (Interaction to Next Paint) | ≤ 16ms on desktop (single 60Hz frame), ≤ 50ms on mid-tier laptop, ≤ 100ms on mobile read-only | RUM + Playwright trace |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | ≤ 0.01 | RUM + Lighthouse-CI |
| TBT (Total Blocking Time) | ≤ 100ms | Lighthouse-CI |
| TTI (Time to Interactive) | ≤ 2.0s on cable | Lighthouse-CI |
| TTFB (Time to First Byte) | ≤ 200ms edge-cached, ≤ 500ms origin | RUM + Caddy access log |
| Step-animation transition | ≤ 400ms total, no dropped frames | Playwright trace |
| Long task count (RUM) | 0 tasks > 50ms during steady interaction | PerformanceObserver in `apps/web/src/lib/rum.ts` |
| Active DOM nodes per route | ≤ 500 | Playwright DOM count assertion |

## Frame budget

| Display refresh | Target | Floor | p99 frame time |
|---|---|---|---|
| 60 Hz | 60 fps | 60 fps | ≤ 16.67 ms |
| 120 Hz / ProMotion | 120 fps | 60 fps | ≤ 8.33 ms when 120fps active |
| 144 Hz gaming | 144 fps | 60 fps | ≤ 6.94 ms |
| 240 Hz gaming | 240 fps | 60 fps | ≤ 4.16 ms |
| 360 Hz gaming | 360 fps | 60 fps | ≤ 2.77 ms (cap) |

`<Canvas frameloop="demand">` ensures idle frame cost = 0 ms (no render when no state changes). Idle CPU + GPU usage = 0 (verified via `r3f-perf` + Chrome perf trace).

Refresh-rate detection at canvas mount via `screen.refreshRate` (or `matchMedia('(update: fast)')` proxy); animation step duration scales inversely with refresh rate so transitions feel identical across displays. Refresh rate above 360 Hz capped at 360 fps target — diminishing returns past human perception.

## 3D scene-specific budgets

| Resource | Budget |
|---|---|
| Draw calls per frame | ≤ 50 in hero datapath scene, ≤ 100 in K-map toroidal, ≤ 200 absolute cap |

| Pipeline trace arrange 100 cycles × 20 instructions | ≤ 30 ms |
| Critical-path longest-path walk | ≤ 5 ms |

Memory leak detection via Playwright `page.coverage` + heap snapshot diff between identical sim cycles.

## Cold-start vs warm-cache

| Path | Cold | Warm |
|---|---|---|
| Landing route | ≤ 1.0s LCP | ≤ 200ms LCP (CF edge cached) |

| `/kmap` interactive | ≤ 1.5s TTI | ≤ 600ms TTI |
| `/learn/*` MDX | ≤ 1.0s LCP | ≤ 200ms LCP |

## Optimization patterns (locked)

- React Server Components for everything non-interactive
- Suspense streaming with skeleton geometry while 3D scene loads
- Asset preload hints from RSC (`packages/three-kit` exposes `preload()` helpers)
- `useTransition` for heavy state swaps in sim
- zustand transient subscribes for hot-loop state (skip React render)
- Instanced meshes for any geometry count > 100
- BVH raycasting (drei `Bvh`) for cell picking in K-map
- Frame-loop on demand (`<Canvas frameloop="demand">`) — only render when state changes, freezes when idle
- Geometry / material pooled and reused — no per-frame allocations
- Object pooling for hot-loop Vector3 / Quaternion / Matrix4 allocations
- AOT shader compilation at scene mount via `renderer.compile(scene, camera)` — eliminates first-use shader compile stutter
- Pre-warmed Worker pool at app boot — QM + assembler + pipeline workers idle-warm, zero spin on first heavy compute
- Texture KTX2 + zstd for any future raster (currently none per asset-authoring ADR)
- HTTP/3 + Brotli compression at Caddy (level 6 dynamic, level 11 static at build)
- 104 Early Hints via Caddy — preload critical fonts + 3D bundle while origin computes
- Web Workers for compute > 16ms (QM, Espresso, pipeline analyzer, assembler for > 100 line programs)
- Pixel ratio capped at 2 on high-DPI displays to prevent over-rendering
- `contain: strict` on 3D scene container for layout isolation
- `content-visibility: auto` on off-screen panels (sidebar register/memory/control tables out of viewport)
- Critical CSS inlined via Tailwind 4 JIT
- React Compiler enabled, all files compiled — manual `useMemo` / `useCallback` deleted
- CSS containment on every Card / Panel surface
- `'use cache'` server-side memoization for QM solver results + assembler output + critical-path computation, keyed by input hash (per `adr/server-cache-budgets.md`)
- `cache()` from React 19 for RSC fetch deduping within a request
- `fetchpriority="high"` on critical fonts + above-fold 3D bundle
- View Transitions API for cross-route navigation (Next 16 native)
- Speculation Rules API — prerender likely-next routes on hover/idle (per `adr/speculative-loading.md`)
- Stale-while-revalidate at CDN — survive flagged-then-purge edge race for permalink reads
- Preemptive scrub seeking — when user drags timeline scrubber, pre-compute frames ahead of cursor in idle gap
- Service Worker pre-caching of likely-next-routes on idle (PWA layer)
- OffscreenCanvas + R3F-in-Worker — entire 3D rendering off main thread (per `adr/offscreen-canvas-render.md`)
- Typed arrays for sim-engine state — `Int32Array(32)` register file, `Uint8Array` memory, no `Record<>` for hot state (per `adr/runtime-optimization-discipline.md`)
- Struct-of-arrays (SoA) layout for pipeline trace + K-map cell state arrays (cache locality)
- Hidden class stability — hot-path object shapes locked at construction, no post-construction property addition
- Monomorphic call sites — sim-engine + solver paths stay monomorphic (V8 inline cache)
- `Object.freeze` on hot config objects (delay table, control truth table, opcode map)
- Iterative (not recursive) QM + Petrick implementation
- Scheduler API (`scheduler.postTask` with explicit priorities) for compute dispatch
- `await scheduler.yield()` between work units in long-running hot paths
- `requestIdleCallback` for telemetry batching, abuse-flag scrubs, catalog index updates
- Mesh batching via `BufferGeometry.mergeGeometries` for static datapath substrate elements
- Programmatic LOD via drei `Detailed` — simpler geometry at distance
- `renderer.autoClear = false` with manual clear of only-dirty regions
- Texture atlas for shader-baked etched labels (single texture binding)
- GPU instancing required for any repeated mesh > 8 instances
- Eager per-page font subsetting via fonttools at build (only glyphs present on the page)
- `structuredClone` over `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` for deep copy
- `WeakMap` / `WeakRef` for collectable caches (snapshot decode cache, etc.)
- Server Action streaming responses for QM step-through reveal + assembler progress
- Zero 301/302 redirects — direct routing always
- Precompiled regexes at module top-level, reused
- Mutate-in-place over `slice` / `concat` in hot loops
- Compile-time pre-computation — golden traces, K-map solver results for canonical fixtures, datapath topology pre-arranged ship as static JSON. Zero runtime compute for fixture loads
- Zstd content encoding for static assets (build-time, alongside Brotli L11; browser negotiates via `Accept-Encoding: zstd`)
- TCP BBR congestion control on origin VM (kernel sysctl) — measurable on real connections
- Adaptive quality via drei `PerformanceMonitor` — under FPS pressure auto-downgrade pixel ratio + LOD detail tier, restore on recovery
- Device-tier detection at boot (`navigator.hardwareConcurrency`, `navigator.deviceMemory`, GPU heuristic) — high-tier full detail, mid-tier reduced LOD, low-tier read-only-equivalent
- GPU timer queries via `EXT_disjoint_timer_query` extension — real GPU frame time measured, not assumed
- Adaptive pixel ratio — under FPS pressure scale down before stuttering, cap at `Math.min(2, devicePixelRatio)` baseline
- AbortSignal everywhere — every async op accepts + checks `AbortSignal`; nav drops in-flight work
- Geometry / material / texture `.dispose()` on unmount — GPU resource cleanup discipline
- Server Timing header (`Server-Timing: db;dur=12,render;dur=8`) — RUM aggregation of server-side latency breakdown
- Tab visibility pause — telemetry + idle compute paused when `document.visibilityState === 'hidden'`
- Idle detection via `IdleDetector` (where available) or `requestIdleCallback` heuristic — non-critical compute paused on user idle
- Workbox precache by revision keys (not URL) — bundle hash drives cache invalidation
- `CompressionStream` / `DecompressionStream` for client-side zstd decode of snapshot bodies (Safari fallback to `fzstd` wasm)
- `scheduler.yield()` inside extended `useFrame` work units — keeps frame budget elastic when heavy compute leaks into render path
- `will-change` CSS audit — applied only to elements provably benefitting from compositor promotion, removed when no longer animating
- HTTP/3 0-RTT enabled in Caddy config — instant resume for repeat visitors
- Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP) header on served assets — `same-origin` for product, `cross-origin` for substrate OSS bundles when shareable
- Resource Timing API client-side aggregation → `/api/rum` — per-asset latency, cache state, transfer size for tuning
- Network Information API (`navigator.connection`) — adapt quality + prefetch eagerness to actual connection. `effectiveType` slow-2g/2g/3g/4g; `saveData=true` disables prerender, downgrades render quality, suppresses non-critical prefetch
- `pointerrawupdate` events for input on high-refresh displays — uncoalesced pointer events for smooth scrub on 120Hz+
- `<link rel="modulepreload">` for code-split bundles — bridges preload (eager) and prefetch (lazy); applied to next-likely route bundles
- `navigator.scheduling.isInputPending()` (Chrome-only) inside long-running compute — yield when input pending, fallback to `scheduler.yield()` elsewhere
- Predictive input for timeline scrubber — extrapolate pointer trajectory direction, pre-compute frames in anticipated direction via idle callback
- `Save-Data` HTTP header respect — disable Speculation Rules, downgrade render quality to mid-tier, suppress non-critical prefetch
- Priority Hints catalog — `fetchpriority="high"` on critical fonts + above-fold 3D bundle, `fetchpriority="low"` on prefetched far-route bundles + telemetry batches

## Anti-patterns banned

- Per-frame `setState` in `useFrame` (mutate refs instead)
- New object props on R3F components in render (`useMemo` or stable refs)
- Synchronous JSON parsing > 16 ms on main thread (Web Worker)
- Layout thrash (batch DOM reads/writes)
- Render-blocking third-party scripts (none allowed regardless)
- `setState` cascades (use `useReducer` or zustand)
- Synchronous `JSON.stringify` of large objects on main thread
- Reading `getBoundingClientRect` during animation frame (cache)
- `forEach` in hot loops (use `for` loop)
- New `Vector3()` / `Matrix4()` / `Quaternion()` allocations in `useFrame` (pool them)
- Mounting heavy components synchronously without Suspense boundary
- Cold Worker spin on first heavy compute (workers must be pre-warmed)
- First-use shader compile during user-visible animation (AOT compile at scene mount)
- Off-screen panel rendering when scrolled out of viewport (use `content-visibility: auto`)
- `useEffect` for read-after-render measurements that fire on every render (use `useLayoutEffect` or `useSyncExternalStore`)
- Re-allocation of large arrays during hot path (Float32Array pre-allocated and reused)
- Post-construction property addition on hot-path objects (hidden class deopt)
- Megamorphic call sites in sim-engine + solver (V8 inline-cache deopt)
- Recursive QM / Petrick / Espresso (use iterative)
- `Record<K, V>` for sim-engine hot state (typed arrays only)
- 301/302 redirects (direct routing always)
- `slice` / `concat` in hot loops (mutate-in-place)
- `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` for deep copy (use `structuredClone`)
- Inline regex literals re-created in hot path (precompile at module top-level)
- Async operations without `AbortSignal` parameter (must accept + check on every iteration)
- Geometry / material / texture allocations not paired with `.dispose()` on unmount (GPU resource leak)
- `will-change` on every animated element (over-use bloats compositor memory — apply only when measurably needed, remove after animation completes)
- Heavy compute continuing on hidden tabs (must pause when `document.visibilityState === 'hidden'`)
- Telemetry transmission on hidden tabs (queue, flush on visibility restore)

## Deferred-with-trigger ratchets

| Ratchet | Trigger to activate |
|---|---|
| WebGPU compute shaders for QM / Espresso solver | Real-world measurement shows current Worker path exceeds budget under realistic load |
| WASM SIMD for solver hot path | WASM solver path lands (per `adr/compute-budgets.md`) and SIMD measurably outperforms scalar |
| Multi-region anycast origin | Operator commits to multi-region infra; current single-region origin hits latency ceiling on real users |
| Edge-rendered RSC (per-region origin) | Same as above |
| SharedArrayBuffer + COOP/COEP | Worker `postMessage` serialization > 5ms p95 on hot-path data |
| Skia / CanvasKit via wasm | Browser Canvas2D measurably bottlenecks any UI surface (unlikely with 3D-dominant product) |
| CPU affinity for server workers | Operator commits to per-core tuning; current default scheduling hits CPU contention |
| ImportMap-based runtime module sharing | Substrate ships as separately-versioned npm artifacts (post extract-on-second-use) |
